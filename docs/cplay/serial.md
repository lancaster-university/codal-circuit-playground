#uBit.serial

##Overview

Serial communication provides a simple way to exchange a series of bytes between one computer and another.  The runtime's implementation of serial is general purpose and supports a number of different modes. It has a circular buffer for both the reception and transmission of data, and provides notifications to the user through the MessageBus.

By default, the baud rate for MicroBitSerial is `115200` and has very little overhead up until
it is used to `send()` or `read()`, at which point buffers are allocated in order
to accommodate incoming or outgoing data.

MicroBitSerial inherits from mbeds' [`RawSerial`](https://developer.mbed.org/users/mbed_official/code/mbed/docs/252557024ec3/classmbed_1_1RawSerial.html)
class, which exposes a lightweight version of `printf()` and incurs minimal overhead
as MicroBitSerial's buffers will not be allocated.

The MicroBitSerial class supports multithreaded operation, ensuring that only
one fiber can access the Serial port at a time.

The USB interface on the micro:bit is the [KL26Z](https://www.mbed.com/en/development/hardware/prototyping-production/daplink/daplink-on-kl26z/#Updating_your_DAPLink_firmware).

!!! note
    On Mac OSX and Linux Serial communication works out of the box, however on Windows an additional
    **[driver](https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration)** is required.

!!! warning
    The baud rate is shared across all instances of MicroBitSerial (this is enforced in hardware).

### Serial modes

There are three modes of operation for all `send()` or `read()` calls:

- `ASYNC` - Returns immediately after fetching any available data for a given call
- `SYNC_SPINWAIT` - Synchronously access the serial port until the selected operation is complete.
                    This mode will lock up the processor, and isn't recommended if multiple fibers are in use.
- `SYNC_SLEEP` - Blocks the current fiber until the selected operation is complete. This mode cooperates with the
                 Fiber scheduler, and should be used in a multi-fiber program.

### Serial debug

In MicroBitConfig.h, the configuration option `MICROBIT_DEBUG` can be used to activate serial debugging
for many of the components in the runtime.

Reads multiple characters from the rxBuff and fills a user buffer.  

   
 
 buffer 
 
 
 a pointer to a user allocated buffer.  
 
 
 
 bufferLen 
 
 
 the amount of data that can be safely stored  
 
 
 
 mode 
 
 
 the selected mode, one of: ASYNC, SYNC_SPINWAIT, SYNC_SLEEP. Each mode gives a different behaviour:  ASYNC - If the desired number of characters are available, this will fill
        the given buffer. Otherwise, it will fill the buffer with however
        many characters there are available.

SYNC_SPINWAIT - If the desired number of characters are available, this will fill
                the given buffer. Otherwise, this method will spin (lock up the processor)
                and fill the buffer until the desired number of characters have been read.

SYNC_SLEEP - If the desired number of characters are available, this will fill
             the given buffer. Otherwise, the calling fiber sleeps
             until the desired number of characters have been read.
   
 
 
Defaults to SYNC_SLEEP.

                the given buffer. Otherwise, this method will spin (lock up the processor)
                and fill the buffer until the desired number of characters have been read.

SYNC_SLEEP - If the desired number of characters are available, this will fill
             the given buffer. Otherwise, the calling fiber sleeps
